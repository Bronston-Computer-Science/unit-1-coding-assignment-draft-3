## Modify the `FitnessTracker.java` file to:

-  Ask the user to input the number of days they exercised in a week (minimum 1, maximum 7).
   -  Ensure the inputted number of days is within this range.
-  Ask the user to input the number of minutes they exercised each day.
   -  Validate the input for each number of minutes whiles ensuring that each inputted value is a number between 0 and 300.
-  Store the exercise minutes in an array.
-  Calculate and print:
   -  The total minutes exercised.
   -  The average minutes per day.
-  The maximum and minimum minutes exercised in a day.
-  Determine if the user met their weekly goal of 150 minutes and print the result.

## Your program output should look like this:

Day 1: 30 minutes  
Day 2: 45 minutes  
Day 3: 60 minutes  
...  
Total Minutes Exercised = 210  
Average Minutes Per Day = 42  
Maximum Minutes = 60  
Minimum Minutes = 30
